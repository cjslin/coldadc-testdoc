The ColdADC is designed with many redundancies to mitigate single point of failure. During functional testing, a number of 
problems were identified. Forunately, none of the problems prevented the ColdADC from achieving a performance that meets 
the key DUNE requirements. In this section we will show the performance results (already summarized 
in Table~\ref{tab:coldadc_specs}) with the ASIC in the nominal configuration, the same configuration that we will 
use for the system-level integration tests at CERN on APA\#7 in the Coldbox and the ICEBERG teststand at FNAL.
