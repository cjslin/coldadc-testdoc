We presented the preliminary performance of the ColdADC in this document. The performance for this first prototype
has already exceeded the previous cold ADC design that are in use at ProtoDUNE and other LAr experiments. 
The noise is very low which enables the possibility of outputing 14-bit ADC code instead of the required 12-bit.
The linearity is reasonable, but below the expectation from simulation. There were also a number of other 
issues identified during the testing program . A series of detailed  studies have pin-point the 
areas of the ASIC that could be optimized to achieve the ultimate performance. Work is underway on the design 
of the second version of the ColdADC to address them.
