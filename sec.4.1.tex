\subsubsection{ColdADC Only}
The noise distribution for 16-channels from one ColdADC chip with the input floating are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:qc_noisewarm} (RT) and Figure~\ref{fig:qc_noisecold} (LN$_2$). The results are given in full 16-bit ADC output. The average noise is 6.7 LSB (302 $\mu$V-rms) at warm and 4.2 LSB (189 $\mu$V-rms) in LN$_2$, in 16-bit. The measurement is done with ColdADC configured after calibration, VDDA2P5/VDDD2P5=2.5 V, VDDD1P2=2.0 V, VDDIO=2.25 V, SDC bypassed. Separate study has shown that SDC noise is negligible.

\subsubsection{LArASIC + ColdADC}
To evaluate the combined noise of LArASIC and ColdADC, 150pF mica capacitor is added to the LArASIC input 
to simulate the capacitance of the detector sense wire. 
Noise characterization is made at both room and LN2 temperatures, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:noise_fullchain}.  
The quantization noise of 12-bit ADC is negligible when LArASIC gain is set to 7.8 mV/fC or higher.
With a shaping time $>$ 2 $\mu$s, the ENC noise is below 630 e$^-$ at RT and $<$ 500 e$^-$ at LN$_2$ temperature.

\end{figure}

The noise dependence on the input capacitance is also studied. In this setup, each input LArASIC channel has
a different capacitor with value that ranges from 22 pF to 150 pF. The input capacitance dependence result in 
LN$_2$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:noise_capacitance} . The four different curves correspond 
to different values of LArASIC shaping time. 
The noise performance comparison between ColdADC BGR and CMOS reference, and comparison between 
SDC and bypassing SDC show no significant difference.
The ENC noise performance for the LArASIC + ColdADC setup has better noise perforamnce compared to 
MicroBooNE, ProtoDUNE, and SBND cold electronics (see results in the Appendix for more detail).

1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 $\mu$s shaping time.}

The DUNE ADC requirement is 12-bit. Given the low noise of the ColdADC, we explore the
