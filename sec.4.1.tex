\subsubsection{ColdADC Only}
The noise distribution for 16-channels from one ColdADC chip with the input floating are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:qc_noisewarm} (RT) and Figure~\ref{fig:qc_noisecold} (LN$_2$). The results are given in full 16-bit ADC output. The average noise is 6.7 LSB (302 $\mu$V-rms) at warm and 4.2 LSB (189 $\mu$V-rms) in LN$_2$, in 16-bit. The measurement is done with ColdADC configured after calibration, VDDA2P5/VDDD2P5=2.5 V, VDDD1P2=2.0 V, VDDIO=2.25 V, SDC bypassed. Separate study has shown that SDC noise is negligible.
