The first prototype of the ColdADC ASIC has been undergoing evaluation at BNL, Fermilab and LBNL since early 2019. In addition to validating the portion of the ASIC that they designed, the three labs also worked collaboratively to cross-check the key performance results and debug issues. In this section, we will describe the setup used for testing the ColdADC.
