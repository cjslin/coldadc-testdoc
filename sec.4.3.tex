The dynamic performance of an ADC is determined by the effective number of bits (ENOB). Figure~\ref{fig:coldadc_fft} shows the Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) from one of the ADC channels.  The ENOB across ADC channels at LN$_2$ temperature is generally fairly uniform with a mean value of 10.6 bits and a spread of about 0.3 bits.
