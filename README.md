## Some useful git commands

```git status``` will show the status of the files in your directory. You'll see the list of files that have been modified and also files that are "untracked".

```git add <filename> ``` will add the newly created file to github. The file will only be in your personal directory until you commit it.

```git rm <filename>``` will delete the file that you not longer want. The file will only be removed in github after you commit the changes.

```git pull``` will update your files to the latest version in github. It's a good idea of pull files often so your local version does not diverge too much from the master version.
