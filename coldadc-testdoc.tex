\begin{abstract}
The DUNE ColdADC is a 16-channel low-noise ADC ASIC designed to read out the LArASIC preamps in the DUNE Liquid Argon Far Detectors. The resolution of the ADC is 12-bits and it digitizes at a rate of 2MS/s/channel. The ADC accepts single-ended or differential inputs and outputs a serial data stream to COLDATA, the DUNE digital data aggregator/serializer chip.

In this document, we present the preliminary performance studies on the first version of the ColdADC ASIC. The prototype ColdADC has already achieved a performance that essentially met the DUNE requirements. We will discuss some of the issues found during the functional tests and the plan to mitigate them in the next revision of the ASIC.
