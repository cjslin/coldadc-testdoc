%(GAO) Discuss ColdADC Channel Crosstalks
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The schematic diagram for the input channel crosstalk study is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xtalk_schematic}. The crosstalk on neighboring channels is
 related to the impedance of the channels. Instead of characterizing the crosstalk for the ColdADC alone, the 
crosstalk from both the LArASIC and ColdADC is measured together in this study. A large calibration charge 
pulse is injected into a specified LArASIC channel, and the responses of the neighboring channels are recorded. A sample crosstalk result at 
room temperature is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:xtalk_RT}. In this case the calibration pulse is injected into CHN0, and the largest crosstalk, close to 1\%, 
is observed on CHN1. The crosstalk on the remaining channels is less than 0.5\%.  When the calibration pulse 
is injected into other channels one by one, it is observed that the next channel within the same ADC core has the largest crosstalk. 
This is an indication that the main contribution of the crosstalk is within the ColdADC itself. At cryogenic temperature, the magnitude of the 
crosstalk is significantly reduced to less than $<$0.5\% across all channels. The results at LN$_2$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xtalk_LN2} with LArASIC configured
for 3$\mu$s shapking time and 14mV/fC gain setting. At 0.5\% level, the crosstalk from LArASIC and ColdADC is neglible compared to the crosstalk 
contribution between sense wires.
